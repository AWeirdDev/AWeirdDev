## what im working on
project you don't want. literally.

- `fastcall` - json-rpc implementation written in rust for python.
- `ora` - to everything.

also, these projects may be paused:
- `flights` - idk why but my Rust toolchain is going crazy just to use the Python library. wtf.

<br />

that's it for now.
