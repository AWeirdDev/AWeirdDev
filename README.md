## some words
ðŸ“£ **hey!** my new project [ddginternal](https://github.com/AWeirdDev/ddginternal) is out now! use duckduckgo search the *funky* way.

- if you're looking for something *googley*, check out `researches` and `flights`

- if you're looking for ai, there are a lot of repos on this topic!

- im thinking of making agent 69 because... agent *zero* sounds a bit "mid"
