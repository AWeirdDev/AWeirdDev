# Hello, World!
Name's AWeirdScratcher.

I enjoy coding and learning new stuff! You might ask, do I use scratch? Well, yes. I enjoyed using scratch **before**, but now I've moved on to the next level!

You could also call me AWeirdDev if you want!

## What I enjoy doing
> I like making discord bots, and web development.

## Having Problems?
```js
>>> const dataScience = fun
                        ^^^
Uncaught ReferenceError: fun is not defined
    at <anonymous>:1:21
```
> **Oh, no!** Seems like an error!

Our team members have a lot of experience, we'll be there, and help you to solve this!
