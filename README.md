## discovery
Prove that 6 * 9 + 6 + 9 can be applied to other numbers:

$`ab + a + b = 10a + b`$

$`ab + a = 10a`$

$`ab = 9a`$

Since $`a`$ is the second digit, $`a > 0`$, therefore:

$`b = 9`$

It is confirmed that any number that:
1. Is a two-digit
2. $`a`$ is any number

You can do the same thing just like 6 * 9 + 6 + 9.

Example:

$$
3*9+3+9=39
$$
