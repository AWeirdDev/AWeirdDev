Ideas are just too many. Below are some ideas that I have. There are currently 2 on-going delays<sup>1</sup>. A ballon emoji indicates that this is a new project/idea.

Sorted from latest to oldest.

- [ ] researches
- [ ] ~~ðŸŽˆ getitunes â€“ iTunes search API (+ downloader for Podcasts)~~ no.
- [x] ~~IPycolonel~~
- [x] ~~AWeirdDev/flights fixes~~
- [x] ~~Protonbites~~

<sup>1</sup> **delays**: Common causes of a delay are a) I find the project unhelpful (or even useless) to the developers/users; b) I don't have motivation (e.g., lack of activities of a repo); c) I'm busy at work thus I don't have time to develop/maintain the projects.
